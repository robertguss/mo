# CBMC proofs

`make cbmc` (or `bash cbmc/prove.sh [proof...]`) proves the bytecode reader,
`src/bytecode/read.c`, with [CBMC](https://www.cprover.org/cbmc/). For **every input of up to
`MO_CBMC_INPUT` bytes** (32 by default), decoding:

- reads and writes only inside the objects it was given or allocated (bounds and pointer checks);
- never overflows a signed integer, shifts out of range, divides by zero, or loses a value in an
  implicit conversion;
- never fails an `MO_ASSERT`;
- and, when it refuses, leaves an error with a reason and an offset inside the input.

This is a bounded proof, not a test: CBMC checks every input of that size, not a sample. It
complements `fuzz/fuzz_bytecode_io.c`, which runs much larger inputs but only some of them.
Architecture section 11 ("Small critical C functions") and task V4 (MO-54) ask for it.

## How the proof is split

Proving the whole decoder in one run does not scale. So `reader.c` writes a specification for
each function of `read.c`: what it requires of the reader, and what it guarantees about the
reader, the input and the tables it returns. Each specification is used twice:

- **Proof.** `harness_<f>` builds any reader that meets `f`'s requirements, calls the real `f`,
  and asserts its guarantees, including that it changed nothing else.
- **Model.** `model_<f>` asserts `f`'s requirements, then forgets what `f` may change and assumes
  its guarantees. `prove.sh` swaps the model in for every call to `f` in the proofs of its callers
  (`goto-instrument --replace-calls f:model_f`).

So each proof covers one function, with its callees trusted only as far as their own proofs
show. `read.c` is included, not linked, so its static functions can be proved one by one. Its
loops over entries call one function per entry (`type_entry`, `parameters`, `module_entry`,
`debug_entry`, `choice_cases`), which keeps every proof small.

| Proof | Checks | Replaces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `word`, `boolean` | one little-endian word, offset kept inside the input | `word` |
| `allocate`, `scratch` | a fresh block of exactly the size asked, or a no-memory refusal | |
| `array`, `indices` | a count within its limit and the bytes left, and its table | `word`, `allocate`, `array` |
| `utf8` | `mo_bytecode_utf8` reads only its bytes | |
| `blob` | a length within the bytes left, copied and NUL-terminated | `word`, `allocate`, `mo_bytecode_utf8` |
| `name`, `fields`, `choice_cases` | name indices checked against the strings table | `word`, `array`, `name`, `fields` |
| `type_entry`, `types` | one type of each kind, then the types table | the helpers above |
| `constants`, `parameters`, `functions` | each constant and function, and their tables | the helpers above |
| `module_entry`, `debug_entry` | one module or debug record and its positions | `word`, `array`, `boolean`, `indices` |
| `sections` | every section in order, the reader's objects unchanged | every function above |
| `decode` | `mo_bytecode_decode_info`: header, checksum, trailing bytes, types' references | `allocate`, `sections` |

Loops are unwound to bounds the input size implies (a table has at most `MO_CBMC_INPUT / 4`
entries), and every bound carries an unwinding assertion, so a bound that is too small fails the
proof rather than hiding paths.

`bash cbmc/prove.sh --reach` checks the other way a proof can be empty: that some path reaches
the end of each harness. It builds with `MO_CBMC_REACH`, which puts a failing assertion at the
end of every harness, and passes only when that assertion is the one failure. CI runs both.

## What the proofs assume

These neighbours are models, each with its own checks:

- **The arena** (`src/base/arena.c`) hands out each block as its own object of exactly the size
  asked, and may fail any allocation. Its own proof is task V5.
- **The name table** (`src/bytecode/names.c`) gives each string a canonical index that is absent
  or no later than its own, which is all the reader relies on.
- **The validator** (`mo_bytecode_validate`) may accept or refuse anything; a refusal has a reason
  and an offset inside the input. `mo_case_shape` is only asserted to be called with a decoded
  type and case.
- **`mo_assert_failed`** asserts, so a failed `MO_ASSERT` fails the proof (CBMC would treat a
  plain `abort` as a path that never happened).
- **`memcpy` and `memchr`** are plain byte loops: CBMC's library has no `memchr`, and its
  `memcpy` is very slow with a symbolic offset and length.

## Running it

`.agents/setup` installs CBMC from the distribution (Ubuntu 24.04 ships 5.95.1), and CI runs it
as the `cbmc` group of `ci/check.sh`. A failed proof prints its failing properties; the full log
is `build/cbmc/<proof>.log`. Adding `--trace` to the `cbmc` command `prove.sh` runs, on
`build/cbmc/<proof>.goto`, shows a counterexample. To cover larger inputs, set `MO_CBMC_INPUT`;
the time grows with it.
